# FNMC-Archival
The FNMC staff and volunteers maintain this repository to serve as the official archive for past and future events hosted by FNMC.

Historically, event archiving was limited and inconsistent, often capturing only a single channel per event. In response, we have implemented a more comprehensive system. Beginning in 2025 and moving forward, entire event categories will be archived to ensure complete and accurate preservation of all related discussions and content.

Our goal is to create a reliable and accessible historical record of community activities and shared experiences.
