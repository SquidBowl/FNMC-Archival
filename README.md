# FNMC-Archival
An official repositiory hosted by FNMC staff to archive events.

This repository hosts archives of past and future events hosted by FNMC. Past events were ineffectively archived, so we adapted to a better system. In future events (2025 - onwards), the entire category for
events will be archived opposed to past events where it was only 1 channel.
