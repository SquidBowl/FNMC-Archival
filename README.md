# FNMC-Archival
The FNMC staff and volunteers maintain this repository as the official archive for both past and future events hosted by FNMC.

Historically, event archiving was limited and inconsistent, often preserving only a single channel per event. To address this, we have implemented a more comprehensive archiving system. Starting in 2025, entire event categories will be archived to ensure thorough and accurate preservation of all related discussions and content.

We aim to build a reliable and accessible historical record of the communityâ€™s activities and shared experiences.

**Please note: These exports/archives may include unmoderated or unexpected content, especially in older records, as preservation accuracy is prioritized.**

## HOW TO OPEN AND READ
1. Find the event you wish to open, and download the HTML file.
2. Upon downloading, open the HTML file in your preferred browser
3. Enjoy! :)
