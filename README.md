# FNMC-Archival
The FNMC staff and volunteers maintain this repository as the official archive for both past and future events hosted by FNMC.

Historically, event archiving was limited and inconsistent, often preserving only a single channel per event. To address this, we have implemented a more comprehensive archiving system. Starting in 2025, entire event categories will be archived to ensure thorough and accurate preservation of all related discussions and content.

We aim to build a reliable and accessible historical record of the community’s activities and shared experiences.

**Please note: These exports/archives may include unmoderated or unexpected content, especially in older records, as preservation accuracy is prioritized.**
